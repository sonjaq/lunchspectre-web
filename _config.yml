# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: "The haunting funk of Lunch Spectre is the result of years of friendship, ups and downs, and a shared love of music, bass, and weird things. Chad Haugejorden and Sonja Q Leaf are Lunch Spectre. This partial product of the pandemic was a long time coming, and is some of their most personally-satisfying work."
